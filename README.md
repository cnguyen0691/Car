# Car
Your client is a car dealership. Their competitor across the street has a site that looks like this: https://polar-anchorage-42314.herokuapp.com/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

They want a site that will give them the same capabilities: the ability to add, update, delete and list cars for sale; the ability to put those cars in categories and show the cars in a category.

It can't look EXACTLY like that site, that's how you get sued.
Don't over-complicate it. Simplicity is best.
Start with the H2 database or MySQL.
Use Bootstrap to style your site and make it look good.
Deploy your application to Heroku after you switch the database to PostgreSQL.
